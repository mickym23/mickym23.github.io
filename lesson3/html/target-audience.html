   <h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>
   We hope that this site has something that everyone can take information from. The main audience that <br>
   would be using this site would be between the ages of 20 and 35. People who are single or are recently married. <br>
   Most would be on-the-go, working people who are travelling often to various places in the week, and spend time <br>
   outdoors on the weekends. These people would be using mobile most of the time for efficiency, however many also have 
   desktops at their workplaces to view the site quickly.
