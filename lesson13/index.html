      (5/5) Been here to this franchise twice while going to the Nauvoo Temple, 
      it's an absolute pleasure to stay here. Definitely a must when staying in Nauvoo!
   </p>
   <p class = "right">
      (4/5) I like the system they have with regards to the booking and scheduling. Place is always neat and clean, 
      although I would prefer fresh towels each day, but nonetheless, great service.
   </p>
   <p class = "left">
      (5/5) Grounds are well-kept, it's not cramped with lots of people which is nice. Lovely lounge where you get the 
      opportunity to meet new people from all around the world. 
   </p>
   <p class = "right">
      (5/5) If there was more options, I'd boost it to a 10/5! I would say that I'm a fairly active person. When I found out
      that they had an exercise gym at the place, it was a done deal. They have all the equipment you could ever ask for!

      <p>Plans to construct the temple were announced 4 April 1999, Church leaders broke ground 24 October 1999, and Gordon B. Hinckley, 
         president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints from 1995 to 2008, dedicated the Nauvoo Illinois Temple 27 June 2002. 
         The temple serves Latter-day Saints in western Illinois and eastern Iowa. <br>
